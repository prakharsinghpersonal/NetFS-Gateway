- Commit 2 (POSIX Translation): Implement the core Go logic that translates standard POSIX file system requests into GCP Cloud Storage API calls (bucket objects).
- Commit 3 (Caching & Optimization): Add an in-memory or local disk caching layer in Go to optimize read/write latency and reduce direct GCP API calls.
- Commit 4 (Distributed State): Implement a distributed lock or metadata synchronization mechanism (e.g., using Redis or etcd) to ensure consistency across multiple gateway instances.
- Commit 5 (Deployment & Polish): Expose Prometheus metrics endpoints for gateway performance, containerize the app, and document the GCP setup instructions.
